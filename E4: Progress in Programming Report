I would say my programming skills have improved phenomenally this past semester as now I feel confident in the process of building a simple program and have been able to expand my knowledge of coding and most importantly develop further knowledge of coding terminology and understand what the specific use of functions, loops, variables, the difference between server side and client side processing, whether a page is static or dynamic, what are cascading style sheets and what they're used for and how to use them to further enhance the style of your webpages, and why the proper placement of code matters when it comes to the execution of your code, and so much more that I feel that my previous life as a Computer Science major had never built the fundamental knowledge for me, in regards to programming. I need to work on making sure I fully understand what each piece of code those and also fully understand how I can go about code I have previously written and implemented in my labs/wods that can apply to my assignments in this class, with assignment one being difficult due to the assignment being a majority of the concepts that were introduced to us through the WODs/labs but now we had to go about taking all that we learned and make a functional store, index, and invoice webpage that would calculate an invoice, give you errors if invalid quantities where entered in your quantity_input, and so much more. This wasn't easy due to me having a general idea of how to make certain elements of the project work, but bringing it all together was by far the most challenging part and I don't know how I would have been able to do so if we were not provided a template. I have learned a lot from the WODs and I do feel comfortable with doing most without any sort of help such as a screencast but when it comes to the WOD Store 1, I still to this day do not believe I could effectively execute that WOD without utilizing AI, as trying to do it in the time limit for this WOD is a challenge to say the least. The labs have most definitely helped me learn and I feel confident in my ability to perform a good majority of the actions/code that we learned through the labs, with a few labs I feel not as confident with redoing without the help of AI and so forth. I have most definitely learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel generally confident and ready to work on Assignment 2, I know that our current lab will play a key role in our tasks for Assignment 2 so I feel my confidence will increase once we have finished our current lab. I think the class can be improved to help my learning, with clearer instructions and less doing things completely on our own at certain times. I understand that being clear and concise is a difficult task and that every person will interpret information in a slightly different way than others. Still, more concise and maybe bulleted requirements would be helpful, for labs and so forth instead of lots of mini paragraphs with requirements, and actions that are expected of us. Also, it is important to have us figure out some things on our own, but some things are best to be shown how to do first and then asked of us to do, a great example of this was our Google Cloud deployment for our last assignment that many students, me included had many troubles upon deploying our assignment, the timely ness of the deploying the assignment, is something that I feel should have been done in the previous week not the week of the assignment, causing stress upon deployment and properly finishing assignment one. What helps me the most in class, is without a doubt working with others in this class, asking the TA's/Professor Port for help, and utilizing AI tools such as Chat GPT to figure out the various problems/issues that arise in this class. I feel like what has helped me the most in my learning, was doing the WODs as this made you truly think and have to figure out programming issues/scenarios in real-time while being recorded, as this style of learning, where the pressure and spotlight is on you to perform, is in my opinion the best way for me to learn. I will say though I think some WODs, should be given more time to complete under DNF, such as Store 1, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the WODs in general and how much I felt I was learning. The readings, screencasts, and so forth were helpful as well but I believe I never truly understood the material until I had to implement it in a lab or a WOD.
