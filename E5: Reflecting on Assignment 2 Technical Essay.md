Assignment 2 had us upgrading our original Assignment 1 and the attributing pages linked to our store for Assignment one, with the use of a registration page, a way in which to log out from the invoice, to learn more about Assignment 2, feel free to take a look at this link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2/. This assignment in general taught me how to properly use if statements more, I also learned how to save new data with the fs.writeFileSync. With me learning how to retrieve data that was within the query string, I also learned how to personalize the display from data within the query string. In regards to if I worked with a partner, I did not work in a team I did this by myself, with a heavy usage of AI such as ChatGPT and so forth. When I needed help I consulted with a few of the TAs, some friends, and a heavy use again of AI and ChatGPT, I needed help extensively on IR5 as I was confused in general on how it was supposed to work, to begin with, with it not updating when a use logged out initially and me spending hours figuring out how to properly troubleshoot this issue. Developing this assignment was different from developing assignment one primarily with how, I primarily had to learn and RTFM many things that I have never learned before, with me having to refer back to previous readings and W3 Schools. In regards to the estimated amount of time percentage-wise, I had probably spent 20% of my time thinking about how to do something and how to properly ask Chat GPT to help me make the code needed for my Assignment 2, 30% of my time actually writing my code and then 50% of the time debugging and testing the code. What worked well in this project was pretty much everything up to trying to implement IR5 and trying to get the query string to move through the login/registration page, then to the invoice, coming up with the right combination and lines of code to execute IR5 and the query string issue, proved to be the most difficult part of this assignment, other than that implementing the templates from W3 schools and getting the registration and login page to work was not of the biggest concerns to me and I say worked generally well. If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would have put more emphasis on this assignment and dedicated more time to the assignment overall, not cramming to get this assignment finished. I had many other obligations so trying to get this assignment done was a true challenge overall.
