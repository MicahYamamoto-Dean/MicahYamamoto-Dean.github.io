## Summary 

To summarize the Browser History WODS: Browser History one, had us create a simple webpage using VScode that consisted of a table of contents, embedded links to external sources, images to go with our sections, and much more. Browser History 2 involved us using CSS or cascading style sheets, which allowed us to edit and restyle the webpage, we had created from Browser History 1, such as changing the background color to Ivory, changing the text colors, changing the font types, repositioning/reformating the size and placement of the images, and much more. In Browser History 3, we further exercised and applied our knowledge of both HTML and CSS, editing the format of the webpage, making a navigation bar, dividing our text into columns, using new tags such as padding, and so much more. A disclaimer is that my WOD timer might have been working properly or is working properly and I am just hard on myself when it comes to personal grading of my performance.

## WOD 1

WOD 1 took me two attempts, with one at approximately 20 minutes so SD, even though the WOD timer stated I finished in AV at 17 minutes and my first attempt took me an hour and 32 minutes, DNF. This WOD was the most challenging out of all three of the WODs, having to now use what we had just learned in class, such as the EMMET boilerplate, img HTML tags, hyper reference HTML tags, ID HTML tags, and so much more content that we had just learned in class/labs or have not learned nor touched upon at all up until this point. My first attempt took me well over an hour... maybe even two and I was under a lot of stress, to say the least, and was having tremendous troubles with my HTML code and doing a tremendous amount of troubleshooting to get it to work. After watching the portion of the screencast, that told you how to properly use the ID tag and make the table of contents, I felt confident to try it again, getting let's just say an AV on my second attempt and feeling a tremendous amount of growth and accomplishment after finishing it on my second attempt. I learned a lot about some of the inner workings of HTML tags, through this WOD, and I learned that it is much more rewarding and beneficial to attempt it first, and then if you're having any major trouble watch the solution video, in which I was glad that I did. You will also find that the solution video, matter of fact, always is able to execute what you want it to do in a much easier and simpler fashion than you would have thought...unless you know your stuff really well.

## WOD 2

WOD 2 took me two attempts, with approximately 10 minutes so AV, even though the WOD timer gave me RX at 8 minutes, and 30 minutes for my first attempt, DNF. Unlike WOD 1, this WOD was much more straightforward to troubleshoot. I enjoyed our extensive use of CSS, having worked with CSS before in ICS 101 and remembering many of the components of it. I think by far the hardest part for me, was figuring out how to change the font, with constant troubleshooting and searching up ways in which to do this, without using any AI to help me. After skimming through the solution video and getting to the part in which they use the Google Fonts for developer's website and hyperreference it, I felt a little discouraged. This was due to how easy and seamless the professor made it seem, but I was happy that I got my solution at least. My first attempt was pretty much me just trying to figure out the font issue and then my second attempt went by easily, once I was able to figure out this problem.


## WOD 3

WOD 3 took me four attempts, at approximately 9 minutes so RX, 4 minutes DNF because I stopped the video, 45 minutes DNF, and 30 minutes DNF, according to the WOD timer. This was probably the second most challenging, primarily because splitting the text into three sections was a nightmare for me to figure out at first and then I eventually caved in and watched the portion, in which to do this, the navbar was also another difficult part, primarily because I forgot to add a hashtag to reference the ID from the index.html. The main reason why it took me so many attempts, is primarily due to me not being able to section the text properly and my roommate at my dorm making noise while I was trying to record. Overall this WOD was enjoyable and rewarding, and had further showed me at this point that my technical and troubleshooting skills were improving and I was able to find solutions to many problems, without the help of the solution videos and/or the internet or AI.

## Advice

Advice I would give for future ITM 352 students, is to try it on your own first and make mistakes but also make sure you have a copy/backup of your code, in case something goes wrong. Also when you get stuck on one task, try to ponder with it for a while before going to the internet. It is important that you're making mistakes so you can learn and grow from them, don't be reliant on AI or other programs to help you. Don't be afraid to do it multiple times as well and take notes on what you're doing, so you can apply it to your future work in this class.
