## About me

Hello everyone, I am Micah, a Junior at the Shidler College of Business, majoring in Accounting and Management Information Systems. I currently work as a grader for various accounting courses, along with having/had board member and chair positions in the Accounting Club and Beta Alpha Psi. I have lived in Hawaii my whole life, with me primarily residing in Pearl City for the majority of my life and moving around to Waipio, Nānākuli, and many other places, throughout my life. I went to Pearl City High School, where I participated in wrestling, judo, KeyClub, and various other school activities.

## Professional Goals

I would like to obtain my CPA and work in IT Auditing, for Ernst & Young, which is a CPA firm that I will be interning with this summer. I also want to try out various avenues of business/accounting, whether it be traditional External Auditing, Consulting, Tax Services, Real Estate, and so forth. I also would like to dive deeper into Data Analytics and get a possible Six Sigma certification.
