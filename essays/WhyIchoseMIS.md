*Summary*

I choose Management Information Systems (MIS) as a second major to Accounting, primarily because it is a great second major for an accounting major, who is going for their CPA and it is applicable in all fields of business and will allow me to be a more valuable asset for the company I work for in the future.

## Accounting/Business

Overall it is the number once choice for a second major as an accounting major, with every single firm I have talked to, highly regarding and recommending to take MIS as a second major, if I am needing to get extra credits for the 150 credit requirement to sit in for my Certified Public Account (CPA). It is also extremly helpful and supplemental to have an informaition systems background, with how integrated accounting is, with information systems. It is also suplemental and crucial to have atleast a general knowledge of information systems, no matter what industry/aveneue of business, you pursue.
