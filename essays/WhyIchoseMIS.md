## Summary

I choose Management Information Systems (MIS) as a second major to Accounting, primarily because it is a great second major for an accounting major, who is going for their CPA and it is applicable in all fields of business and will allow me to be a more valuable asset for the company I work for in the future.

## Accounting/Business

Overall it is the number one choice for a second major as an accounting major, with every single firm I have talked to, highly regarding and recommending to take MIS as a second major if I need to get extra credits for the 150 credit requirement to sit in for my Certified Public Accounting exams. It is also extremely helpful and supplemental to have an information systems background, with how integrated accounting and the business world in general are, with information systems. It is also supplemental and crucial to have at least a general knowledge of information systems, no matter what industry/avenue of business, you pursue.
